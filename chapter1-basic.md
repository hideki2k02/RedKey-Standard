# Chapter 1: The Average Joe

You got an Device that you carry everywhere, you only use the Internet to browse on a few websites, listen to music and access your bank account.

Although you may think not, even for you basic security practices must be taken seriously. 
You probably think its too much effort for nothing as you will never be a target, but thats where you are wrong.

I was once in your place, thinking that i would never be hacked, and that nobody would be the wise to look into the hidden passwords.txt file in the Desktop. 
"what valuable information do i have" i thought to myself.

Unfortunately we are Human (Unless you're Zuckerberg), we commit mistakes, we feel hate, we feel anger, we sometimes want revenge.
The Bad Actor might not necessarely be an hacker, he might just be your friendly neighbour that decided to snoop around and found something interesting.
Or maybe someone that wants revenge, who knows? That is why we should not leave room for those kinds of slip ups.

### What can i do?
As you probably dont want to get into too much work, my main advices are:
- Dont leave your passwords in the open.
- Dont re-use passwords.
- Dont make your passwords too simple like your birthdate (But please dont make them impossible to rememeber).
- **ALWAYS USE 2-FACTOR AUTHENTIFICATION.**

Detailed explanation below.

### Leaving your passwords in the open

This is basically common sense but its easily ignored so it was mentioned here. Leaving your passwords in the open is a open invite to hackers
that ex that really wants some kind of revenge and that one friendthat likes to cause trouble.

If you must store your passwords somewhere, make sure they are not in the open (on your Desk or on password.txt on your Desktop). Do whatever is viable
to prevent people from getting access to them: Lock the annotations in a drawer that only you have the key, write them in codes, its your call.

**EXAMPLE:** My prefered way of securing my password is to Encrypt them using [KeePass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass), its avaliable everywhere and i can
use extremely secure password whilst only having to remember a Master Password to unlock it, plus i can easily back them up/sync them in the cloud (unlike paper).

### Not reusing passwords
Like i said before, all it takes is being on the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case it means using the same password over and over again
until you register into a site that was then breached by Hackers, now all your accounts are at risk. If you have problems remembering multiple passwords
you can try using a "Composite Password" that is a combination of a password with something to differ it from the other services, sure its not the best
thing to do but its far better thar reusing passwords.

**EXAMPLE:** iLikeDucksss@Google.com

### Dont make your passwords too simple
That gets us to the second thing: Not making your passwords too obvious. If your password is just something like 123, your name + your birthdate you are making 
yourself an easy target, some might even say begging to be hacked. I've seen multiple people getting hacked because they used a obviou password 
(they also reused passwords so the damage was far worse).

If you want to steer clear from problems down the road steer away from passwords like 04081961 or joe1961, use something a little more complicated yet easy to remember.
Most websites will have basic requirements like Uppercase, Special Characters, Numbers, so you can try using a combination of
Character Replacing, Composite Passwords etc. Get creative, but dont make something too hard as there is no point on locking you out of the account.

Tip: Most sites require you to use Numbers, Letters, Special Characters, Uppercase, Lowercase because it makes your password far more resilient to attacks like 
Plain [Bruteforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) and [Dictionary Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack).

**Example:** JohnDoe1961@MyBank2023

### 2-Factor Authentification (2FA for short)
This is the last layer of defense, if your password somehow got leaked this is what will likely stop them at their tracks as long as you followed the previous tips
as a hacker cannot gain access to your account without a 2FA code.
2FA can be implemented in multiple ways but most commonly: Email Confirmations, SMS, Authentification Apps, Popup Confirmation on Mobile Device etc. 
Authentification Apps are prefered as the codes are far harder to get than SMS codes and Emails as those can be easily intercepted.

Biometric Authentification was not mentioned as its mostly used as a "Quick Unlock" rather than a 2FA method. The most common
use for Biometric 2FA is on Phyisical Devices like Smart Locks and Bank ATMs, although on a near future we might also see things like Passwordless Authentification 
using Biometric Data, that could potentially make 2FA not mandatory but only time will tell.

Just a reminder: If your account ever gets breached, change the password. Dont rely on 2FA alone.

**Example:** Logging into JohnDoe1961's account on Google requires you to enter a 6 digit PIN code made using Google Authentificator.
