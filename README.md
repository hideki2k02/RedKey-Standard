# The RedKey Security Standard

On October 31st 2023 at 1:08:25 AM UTC i've received a notification on my Phone: New Login at XXXX.

Due to stubborness, probably overconfidence and underestimating humans, i thought that nobody would ever try and hack me to get my passwords.txt file. And i was right, almost. 

Sure i'm not the President that has to watch for every step as i'm a walking target, but what i've failed to account for is that i did not need to be a VIP to be a target, or even be hacked to become a victim of cyber-attack. All it took was being in the wrong place at the wrong time, in my case a bad actor with brief access to my computer.

That file had all my personal passwords, emails, banking details and some ASCII emojis. Thankfully nothing of value was lost as the Banking Apps required the device to be Authentificated, that did not mean that no damage was done but lets skip the details.

A few weeks after the incident, on November 24, 2023 at 10:38:05 PM UTC i've created the RedKey Standard. The name is based on the [RedKey USB Drive](https://redkeyusb.com/)

### What is it about?
After the incident i've decided to compile a short and simple yet powerful guide on how to keep your accounts safe, security practices, utilities and some other relevant stuff in the topic. I'll try to keep things in Chapters with "Security Levels" as to explain as much as possible without wasting too much of your brain power/time.

Of course, nothing of this will matter if you dont follow the most important tip of all: Common Sense.
